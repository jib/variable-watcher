Variable::Watcher - Keep track of changes on C<my> variables

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ### keep track of scalar changes
    my $scalar : Watch(s) = 1;

    ### keep track of array changes
    my @list : Watch(l) = (1);

    ### keep track of hash changes
    my %hash : Watch(h) = (1 => 2);


    ### retrieve individual mutations:
    my @stack = Variable::Watcher->stack;
    
    ### retrieve the mutation as a printable string
    my $string = Variable::Watcher->stack_as_string;

    ### flush the logs of all the mutations so far
    Variable::Watcher->flush;
    
    ### Set the default reporting filehandle (defaults to STDERR 
    ### -- see the C<GLOBAL VARIABLES> section
    $Variable::Watcher::REPORT_FH = \*MY_FH;
    
    ### Make Variable::Watcher not print to REPORT_FH when running
    ### You will have to use the stack/stack_as_string method to
    ### retrieve the logs. See the C<GLOBAL VARIABLES> section

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Variable::Watcher> allows you to keep track of mutations on C<my>
variables. It will record every mutation you do to a variable that
is being C<Watch>ed. You can retrieve these mutations as a list or
as a big printable string, filtered by a regex if you like.

This is a useful debugging tool when you find your C<my>
variables in a state you did not expect.

See the C<CAVEATS> section for the limitations of this approach.

=head1 Attributes

=head2 my $var : Watch([NAME])

In order to start C<Watch>ing a variable, you must tag it as being
C<Watch>ed at declaration time. You can optionally give it a name
to be used in the logs, rather than it's memory address (this is much
recommended).

You can do this for perls three basic variable types; 

=over 4

=item SCALAR

To keep track of a scalar, and it's mutations, you could for example,
do somethign like this:

    my $scalar : Watch(s) = 1;
    $scalar++;
    

The resulting output would be much like this:

   [Variable::Watcher s -> STORE] Performing 'STORE' on s passing 
   '1' at z.pl line 6
   [Variable::Watcher s -> FETCH] Performing 'FETCH' on s at z.pl 
   line 7
   [Variable::Watcher s -> STORE] Performing 'STORE' on s passing 
   '2' at z.pl line 7

Showing you when you did the first C<STORE>, when you retrieved the
value (C<FETCH>) and when you stored the increment (C<STORE>).

=item ARRAY

To keep track of an array, and it's mutation, you could for example,
do something like this:

    my @list : Watch(l) = (1);
    push @list, 2;
    pop @list;

The resulting output would be much like this:

   [Variable::Watcher l -> CLEAR] Performing 'CLEAR' on l at z2.pl
   line 6
   [Variable::Watcher l -> EXTEND] Performing 'EXTEND' on l 
   passing '1' at z2.pl line 6
   [Variable::Watcher l -> STORE] Performing 'STORE' on l passing 
   '0 1' at z2.pl line 6
   [Variable::Watcher l -> PUSH] Performing 'PUSH' on l passing 
   '2' at z2.pl line 7
   [Variable::Watcher l -> FETCHSIZE] Performing 'FETCHSIZE' on l 
   at z2.pl line 7
   [Variable::Watcher l -> POP] Performing 'POP' on l at z2.pl 
   line 8

Showing you that you initialized an empty array (C<CLEAR>), and 
extended it's size (C<EXTEND>) to fit your first assignment (C<STORE>),
followed by the C<PUSH> which adds another value to your list.
Then we attempt to remove the last value, showing us how perl fetches
its size (C<FETCHSIZE>) and C<POP>s the last value off.

=item HASH

To keep track of a hash, and it's mutation, you could for example,
do something like this:

    my %hash : Watch(h) = (1 => 2);
    $hash{3} = 4;
    delete $hash{3};

The resulting output would be much like this:
    
   [Variable::Watcher h -> CLEAR] Performing 'CLEAR' on h at z3.pl
   line 6
   [Variable::Watcher h -> STORE] Performing 'STORE' on h passing 
   '1 2' at z3.pl line 6
   [Variable::Watcher h -> STORE] Performing 'STORE' on h passing 
   '3 4' at z3.pl line 7
   [Variable::Watcher h -> DELETE] Performing 'DELETE' on h 
   passing '3' at z3.pl line 8

Showing you that you initialized an empty hash (C<CLEAR>), and 
C<STORE>d it's first key/value pair. Then we C<STORE> the second 
key/value pair, followed by a C<DELETE> of the key C<3>.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 @stack = Variable::Watcher->stack( [name => $name, action => $action] );

Retrieves a list of C<Log::Message::Item> objects describing the 
mutations of the C<Watch>ed variables.

The optional C<name> argument lets you filter based on the name you 
have given the variables to be C<Watch>ed.

The optional C<action> argument lets you filter on the type of action 
you want to retrieve (C<STORE> or C<FETCH>, etc).

Refer to the C<Log::Message> manpage for details on how to work with 
C<Log::Message::Item> objects.

        push @rv, $item;
    }

    return @rv;
}

=head2 $string = Variable::Watcher->stack_as_string( [name => $name, action => $action] );

Returns the mutation log as a printable string, optionally filterd on
the criteria as described in the C<stack> method.

Flushes the logs of all mutations that have occurred so far. Returns
the stack, like the C<stack> method would, without filtering.

=head1 GLOBAL VARIABLES

=head2 $Variable::Watcher::REPORT_FH

This is the filehandle that all mutations are printed to. It defaults
to C<STDERR> but you can change it to any (open!) filehandle you wish.

=head2 $Variable::Watcher::VERBOSE

By default, all the mutation are printed to C<REPORT_FH> when they 
occur. You can silence C<Variable::Watcher> by setting this variable to
C<false>. Note you will then have to retrieve mutation logs via the
C<stack> or C<stack_as_string> methods.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module can only operate on the three standard perl data types;
C<SCALAR>, C<ARRAY>, C<HASH>, and only C<Watch>es the first level of a
variable, but not nested ones; ie, a variable within a variable is not
C<Watch>ed.
